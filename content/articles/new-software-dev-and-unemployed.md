# New Software Dev and Unemployed
My coding bootcamp, Code Chrysalis, was a 12-week intensive programming course that finally came to an end at the end of January. I was feeling very optimistic that I'd find a job quickly, thanks to networking and the amount of effort that I had put into my projects and resume.

After applying to over 40 jobs, I got rejection after rejection after rejection. I knew that it was coming, but it still hurt. I reached out to some other software devs who have been in the industry longer to see what sort of advice they could part to me.

Here's what they had to say.

## 1. Don't Give Up  🙇🏾‍♀️

Rejections are a natural part of the process when you're a software engineer. Whether you're a junior or senior level, it doesn't matter. You're going to get rejected many times before finding the company that's right for you. In my case, it's finding a company that's willing to give me a chance to prove that I am a skillfull engineer and a great asset to have on any team.

## 2. Keep Filling Out Job Apps 📄

This one is tough, because there's nothing exciting about filling out hundreds of forms that ask slightly different questions, and then trying to sell yourself with a decent cover letter. 5 applications a day is what's required for and expected of the graduates from the Code Chrysalis bootcamp. I'm already falling behind. I feel myself becoming more relunctant to applying for senior level positions that I'm not sure that I have the expertise for.

But, I've got to get the app numbers up on my job tracker somehow for the weekly job checkin.

## 3. Keep coding 👩🏾‍💻

I noticed that a few of the students that I graduated with have completely stopped committing new code to GitHub. Sure there are probably other things they're working on, such as LeetCode. But, I feel like actually working on projects is the best way to improve our skills. Hence why I made this blog using a Headless Content Management System. It was something I hadn't done before, and thought it would be a good challenge. 

It's not pretty yet, but it is a full-stack app that I've deployed to Firebase for hosting so it is actually live and out there for the world to see.
