# Late Night Coding Challenges With a Toddler

My daughter is finally asleep and my husband is snoring next to her. This is my quiet time in the evening when I try to improve my coding skills and get some work on my projects completed. That includes writing here on my skeleton of a blog that I need to decide what to do with.

Do I want to keep it very simple and go for a minimalistic appearance?

Will people even actually read it?

If so, send me a message on Twitter, because I haven't enabled comments on here yet. Plus I'm mostly active on Twitter anyway.

## The Coding Challenge

So, I have a coding challenge for a big tech company here in Japan. I can't go into the specifics, but everyone I know that has taken the test has been rejected. Keep in mind, it's not a very short challenge. It takes most people 3 days or more to finish it and go through the long submission progress.

## The Results

From what I've heard, some people never get their rejection notice from an actual human. It's sometimes a voice message over a phone, or a very short email without any other information.

## How I Feel About It

At first, I was really motivated and put all of my focus and attention into perfecting the coding challenge. Then, after seeing how many of my alumni got rejected, my motivation took a nosedive. I have about 70% of it completed, but the remaining big is a bit of an annoyance to slog through.

Either way, it still counts as a learning experience. I'm trying to build something that I never would've otherwise. So, even if they do reject me, I'll have something else that I can show off on my portfolio.
